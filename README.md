# Vibe-Chess ♔

A fully-featured chess game created entirely through AI-assisted development without writing a single line of code manually.

## 🎯 About

Vibe-Chess is an experimental project that demonstrates the capabilities of modern AI coding assistants. The entire codebase was generated using VSCode + GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4 as the primary coding agent, showcasing how complex applications can be built through natural language instructions and AI collaboration.

## ✨ Features

- **Complete Chess Implementation**: All standard chess rules including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design with drag-and-drop piece movement
- **Game State Management**: Full move history, undo functionality, and captured pieces tracking
- **Check Detection**: Visual indicators for check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions
- **1v1 Local Play**: Two players can play on the same device
- **Italian Localization**: Interface in Italian language

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start playing!

## 🎮 How to Play

- Click on a piece to select it
- Valid moves are highlighted in blue
- Capture moves are highlighted in red
- Click on a highlighted square to move
- Use "Nuova Partita" to start a new game
- Use "Annulla Mossa" to undo the last move

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JS implementation with ES6+ features
- **Unicode Chess Pieces**: No external assets required

## 🧪 The Experiment

This project was created as an experiment in AI-assisted development:

- **Zero Manual Coding**: Not a single line was written manually
- **AI Collaboration**: Used natural language to describe features and requirements
- **Iterative Development**: Refined through conversation with AI coding assistant
- **Full Functionality**: Despite being AI-generated, implements complete chess rules
